class IndexBtree {
    /**
     * This class implements a standard (n, m) B+ tree that maps variable
     * length secondary key blobs to primary key hashes for retrieval in
     * RAMCloud index operations. The property (n, m) means the smallest
     * non-root node in the system can only have n entries and the largest
     * node in the system can be up to n/m entries at most. In our case,
     * n = mininnerslot  and m = innerslotmax. This B+ does caolesce and
     * rebalance nodes to maintain this invariant.
     *
     * As with most B+ trees, there are leaf nodes which contain n keys/data
     * and inner nodes that contain the n keys and n + 1 pointers to other
     * nodes. However, unlike most trees, the key and data are one and the same
     * in this case since it is desired to sort by not only the secondary key
     * but also the pKHash number. Thus, the inner nodes in this B+ also
     * contain data as well the keys. This key+data combination is called
     * an Entry.
     *
     * The B+ tree is organized such that the root is always in a fixed location
     * after a recovery. This is achieved by storing the B+ nodes as RAMCloud
     * objects so that the nodes are automatically recovered during a crash
     * and the root node is always stored with the same RAMCloud object key
     * (ROOT_ID) so it is possible to continue using the B+ tree after recovery.
     * One important note is that the nextNodeId variable is recovered elsewhere
     * in the system and it is CRUCIAL to set properly after a recovery. The
     * reason is because the system-generated RAMCloud Object Keys for the Nodes
     * depends on that variable. If set incorrectly, new nodes could overwrite
     * live data.
     *
     * One more property worth mentioning is that the entries stored in inner
     * nodes slot refer to the rightmost key of the subtree where the subtree
     * root is the child pointer at that position. This allows the B+ tree to
     * store n entries to n + 1 child pointers as the last entry in the B+
     * tree can be used as a pivot point to choose between the final child or
     * the second last child.
     *
     * The properties of the B+ tree is summarized below
     *      - Keys in the system are (Secondary Key Blob) to (Primary Key Hash)
     *        mappings called Entry's
     *      - Smallest non-Root node contains at least mininnerslots entries
     *      - Largest node contains at most innerslotmax entries
     *      - Nodes are allocated as RAMCloud objects
     *      - Keys are sorted within a nodes
     *      - Inner Node Keys refer to the rightmost leaf key when traversing
     *        the subtree NodeId pointer.

    /**
     * Implements the base class for the inner and leaf nodes of the B+ tree.
     * The main responsibility of the base class is to abstract the complexity
     * of storing variable-sized blobs in a RAMCloud Buffer and provide a
     * vector-like API with set/insert/get/erase operations. The semantics of
     * the data and how to arrange the items within the logical array are
     * determined by the IndexBtree class.
     *
     * Nodes use Buffers to keep track of variable-sized secondary keys, which
     * is also convenient since RAMCloud Objects are serialized to Buffers and
     * read back with Buffers. Due to this structure, it's not uncommon
     * for the Node metadata to be stored in the Buffer along with its secondary
     * keys.
     *
     * Using Buffers also affords the use of virtual copies (externalAppend's),
     * which are used copiously to update the node. For example, when an
     * insert occurs, instead of shifting data, the node performs the following
     * operations (a) virtual copy the first half of the original keys,
     * (b) make a hard copy of the new inserted key, and (c) virtual copy the
     * second half of the original keys.
     *
     * So a simple node structure after an insert may look like this:
     * ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     * | Node A (meta) | keya, keyb | virtual keya, hard keyb, virtual keyc |..
     * ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     *
     * A simple erase (on c) may look something like this
     * ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     * | Node A (meta) | keya, keyb, keyc) | virtual keya, virtual keyb | .....
     * ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     *
     * The important thing to note is that the Node will ALWAYS append a copy
     * (either virtual if it's part of the old keys or hard if it's passed in
     * during an insert) of the keys to the end of the Buffer. This provides
     * two useful properties. The first is that the contents of any pointer
     * (such as a secondary key pointer) returned by the node during its
     * lifetime will remain valid during its lifetime, even if the
     * entry has been 'erased'. Here lifetime means from the time that the
     * local copy is created/read from RAMCloud to the time that the local
     * copy is garbage collected. The second useful property is this allows
     * multiple nodes to be use the same buffer, saving on stack space. So it
     * is also not uncommon to see a buffer layout such as
     *
     * ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     * | Node A(meta)| keysA v1 | Node B(meta)| keysB v1 | keysA v2 | Node C...
     * ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     *
     * The always-appending-a-copy-of-keys-to-the-end property ensures pointer
     * safety within the B+ tree code and allows multiple nodes to share one
     * keyBuffer without using additional space.
     *
     * To support additional structures in subclasses, the base Node class
     * makes the serializeAppendToBuffer() and reinitFromRead() both virtual
     * to support subclasses that need read/write additional data in a buffer
     * for an objectManager read/write. Additionally serializedLength() is
     * also virtual.
